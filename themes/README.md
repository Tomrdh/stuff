# Themes

Here you'll find folders containing some files. To download and apply a theme, save or copy/paste the file ending with `.theme.css`. For Powercord, save also the `powercord_manifest.json` (currently not tested, so it might not work).

[Read this wiki](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/wiki) if you don't know how to apply themes. This link redirects you to the Discord Addons repository.
