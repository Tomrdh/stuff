# Discord Recolor: YouTube

[Discord Recolor](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/DiscordRecolor) was originally created by DevilBro, and I made the YouTube light and dark themes with it. I also used my own [CustomFont](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/tree/master/download-themes-here/CustomFont) theme, available in [Discord Addons](https://tomrdh.github.io/da-website/main).

## Note

You can download the original Discord Recolor [here](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/DiscordRecolor).
