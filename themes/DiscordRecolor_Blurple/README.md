# Discord Recolor: Blurple

[Discord Recolor](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/DiscordRecolor) ¹ was originally created by DevilBro, and I made 2 themes in 1 file with it:

- Dark theme: **CutTheCord black theme** ²
- Light theme: **Full blurple theme**

## Notes

1. You can download the original Discord Recolor [here](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/DiscordRecolor).

2. Warning: **CutTheCord black theme** is not exactly the same theme as [AMOLED Dark Theme Optimized](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/tree/master/download-themes-here/AmoledDarkThemeOptimized.theme.css)! Also my AMOLED themes in Discord Addons do not use Discord Recolor, please remember.
